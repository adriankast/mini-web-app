# mini-web-app

A minimal example demonstrating a web app.
Mainly consists of `server.js` backend and `public/index.html` frontend.
The app displays a button that can be on or off (like a ligh-switch), the state is only stored in memory.

To run it:

1. make sure you have got a recent [node.js](https://nodejs.dev/download) version and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
2. checkout this repository using `git clone https://github.com/adriankast/mini-web-app.git`
3. open the cloned directory
4. run `npm install`
5. run `node server.js` in this directory
6. visit your "app" on http://localhost:3000

The example uses [node.js](https://nodejs.dev) and the [express web server](https://expressjs.com/).
