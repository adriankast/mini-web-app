# mini-web-app

A minimal example demonstrating a web app.
Mainly consists of `server.js` backend and `public/index.html` frontend.
The app displays a button that can be on or off (like a ligh-switch), the state is only stored in memory.

To run it:

1. make sure you have got a recent node.js version installed
2. run `node server.js` in this directory
3. visit your "app" on http://localhost:3000

The example uses node.js and the express web server.
